While the excerpt doesn't describe the physical structure of Victory Mansions, it reinforces the understanding that its inhabitants are subject to the Party's oppressive control, as evidenced by their participation in the orchestrated emotional outburst of the Two Minutes Hate.  The squalor implied by Winston's living conditions in Victory Mansions is further contextualized by the contrast between the visceral hatred directed at the screen and the unquestioning devotion to Big Brother displayed immediately afterward. The building, therefore, serves as a backdrop to the psychological manipulation and control exerted by the Party over its citizens, rather than being described in detail itself.\\n\"}"
