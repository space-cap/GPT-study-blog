Query: Research about the XZ backdoor.

Research Result:
{'input': 'Research about the XZ backdoor.', 'output': "The XZ backdoor (CVE-2024-3094) is a vulnerability discovered in the open-source XZ Utils library.  Malicious code, introduced by a compromised maintainer, allowed for remote code execution (RCE). While initially reported as an SSH authentication bypass, the backdoor's capabilities extend beyond that.  The vulnerability affected versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1.  Because the backdoor was discovered before widespread deployment in production Linux distributions, its real-world impact is considered minimal. However, it highlights the risks associated with supply chain attacks and the importance of keeping software updated."}
