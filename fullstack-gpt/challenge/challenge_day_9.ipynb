The backdoor manipulated sshd, the executable file used to make remote ... The xz-utils package, used by many Linux distributions, had a backdoor that could compromise sshd authentication. Learn how to check and update your Kali installation to avoid this issue. Now that the XZ backdoor has control over sshd, attackers can possess the encryption key used to make the SSH connections hide their malicious code in the SSH login certificate and use it as an entry point to execute various malicious actions on the compromised device - such as stealing files or installing malware (e.g., ransomware ... Because the backdoor was discovered before the malicious versions of xz Utils were added to production versions of Linux, \"it's not really affecting anyone in the real world,\" Will Dormann, a ... CVE-2024-3094 is a vulnerability discovered in the open-source library XZ Utils that stems from malicious code that was pushed into the library by one of its maintainers.. It was originally reported as an SSH authentication bypass backdoor, but further analysis indicates that the backdoor actually enables remote code execution (RCE)..
